# This is the main configuration file for the application.

## EBean
# You can declare as many Ebean servers as you want.
# By convention, the default server is named `default`
ebean.default = "models.*"


## Evolutions
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# Evolutions allows database scripts to be automatically run on startup in dev mode
# for database migrations. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += evolutions
#
play.evolutions {
  # You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
  #db.default.enabled = false
  db.default {
    useLocks = true
    autoApply = true
    autoApplyDowns = false
  }
  # Use transactions.
  autocommit = false
}










## Database Connection Pool
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/SettingsJDBC
# ~~~~~
# Play doesn't require a JDBC database to run, but you can easily enable one.
#
# libraryDependencies += jdbc
#

database.dispatcher {
  executor = "thread-pool-executor"
  throughput = 1
}

## JDBC Datasource
db {
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Developing-with-the-H2-Database
  default.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
  default.url = "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/postgres"
  default.username = postgres
  default.password = "example"
}
